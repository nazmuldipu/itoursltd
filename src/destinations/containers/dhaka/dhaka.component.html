        The Bangabandhu Jamuna Eco Park in Sirajganj, which could become a lucrative spot pulling in local and foreign tourists,
        has been in a sorry state for years. The park, about 125 kilometres north-west of Dhaka, has over 50 varieties of
        timber, fruit and medicinal trees and a zoo, but fails to draw many tourists due to a lack of necessary facilities
        and publicity, said visitors and officials concerned.
        <br/>
        <br/> The 600-acre park on the western end of Jamuna Bridge at Soydabad in the district was opened to public in 2008,
        but the authorities have not taken any initiatives to attract tourists. During a recent visit, this correspondent
        found the park in a state of neglect, with only a handful of visitors. The park has a small zoo with only four cages
        that accommodate only two sick porcupines and a few monkeys and hares.
        <br/>
        <br/> Seven spotted deer were released into the park when it was opened, and their numbers redoubled in five years. But
        the animals have been suffering due to a severe shortage of drinking water, with no ponds dug in the forest, sources
        said. Ibrahim Khalil, in-charge of the park’s wildlife and c, said there were two peacocks in the park, but they
        were shifted to Dhaka after they fell sick a few months ago. “Visitors, especially children, love to see animals
        and birds. Therefore, more of these creatures could be brought to the zoo,” Khalil said, adding the government could
        earn huge revenues from the park if it was taken care of.

        Rayer Bazaar is a well-known thoroughfare in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. It takes only 35 minutes from or via
        Kazi Nazrul Islam avenue and 30 to 40 minutes from Gulistan. to reach there. It is generally regarded as one of the
        historical areas of the city. Rayer Bazaar was founded during the colonial period most probably in the 19th century.
        It was the potters who first started to live here beside the Turag River. This Place was most probably named after
        someone titled Ray. It was easy to find the clay used to make pots in this area and spread it around by boats as
        it was situated near the river.
        <br/>
        <br/> During the Mughal period, this place was famous for pottery and most of the potters of this region used to live
        in Rayer Bazar, because the famous “lal mati” was available in this place. During the Mughal and British Colonial
        period, the red clay was not available in the neighborhoods. As a result, the Potters of Rayer Bazar have a long
        tradition of working with this red clay. According to Dr. Wise, this place was known as “Kumartoli” during the Mughal
        period.
        <br/>

        Thirty kilometers off the Dhaka city on the way to Savar and about five kilometers, the theme park Fantasy Kingdom owned
        by Concord group were formally opened on Feb.19.2002. By this time, it has gained popularity both from the kids and
        from adults.Fantasy Kingdom has become a favorite destination for group outings, picnics, company or family day out.
        Attractive packages are available. Facilities for arranging conference, annual general meeting or any corporate event,
        birthday, wedding or any family party, photo session or video shooting are also available here. Fantasy Kingdom is
        FUN, LOUD & OUT OF THIS WORLD. And the most happening place and amusement park in Bangladesh. People come to visit
        Fantasy Kingdom from all the corner of Bangladesh.
        <br/>
        <br/> Fantasy Kingdom brings a little bit of Disneyland to Bangladesh. It is one of the most spectacular amusement parks
        in the country and has become a great tourist attraction in Dhaka. South Asia had never before experienced an enjoyment
        park of such a grand scale and it took the creativity, dedication and promise from hundreds of workers, artists and
        sculptors to bring this world of entertainment and thrills to life.
        <br/>
        <br/> Visitors to the Fantasy Kingdom amusement park will also find a four-star luxury hotel at the park that has two
        hundred rooms, condominiums and its very own resort city. Souvenir shops, merchandise stores and food vendors are
        all located inside the park walls, so visitors are able to browse after they have enjoyed their adventure rides.
        Unfortunately, not many of the locals of Bangladesh are able to afford the entry fee into the park. Most of the community

      <p>
        To reach there Buses are available from Gulistan, Dhaka. Buses take approximately (2-2:30) hours to reach Munshiganj Court
        bus stand. Idrakpur fort is only five minutes walking distance from the bus stand. Munshiganj can also be reached
        by launch from Sadarghat launch Terminal, Dhaka.
        <br/>
        <br/> Idrakpur Fort is a river fort situated in Munshiganj, Bangladesh. The fort was built approximately in 1660 A.D.
        According to a number of historians, the river fort was built by Mir Jumla II, a Subahdar of Bengal under the Mughal
        Empire, to establish the control of Mughal Empire in Munsiganj, and to defend Dhaka and Narayanganj from the pirates.
        <br/>
        <br/> The fort was a part of the triangular defence strategy for the vulnerable river route, from where the pirates used
        to attack Dhaka. The strategy was developed by Mir Jumla II with the help of the other two forts in Narayanganj-
        the Hajiganj Fort and the Sonakanda Fort.This brick built fort, quadrangular in size, runs from north to south measuring
        86.87 meter in length and 59.60 meter in breadth. It consists of two main parts: i) the wider open area surrounded
        by curtain walls crowned by machicolated merlons, with engaged rounded corner bastions also crowned by merlons and
        pierced by musketry, and ii) the smaller area containing a round drum of huge dimension surrounded by another series
        of similar curtain walls. An approach to the drum is provided from the bigger court.
        <br/>
        <br/> The most striking feature of the fort is the existence of an elevated rounded platform of 32.5 diameter and 9.14
        meter high on the eastern part of the fort, which can be reached by a staircase. Another striking feature of the
        fort is the existence of a staircase leading to an underground room at the foot of the drum. Tradition goes that
        the staircase is a part of the provision for an underground tunnel meant for emergency exit of its occupants to some
        safe destination. But virtually the staircase simply leads to a secret underground chamber which was the magazine
        or storehouse for arms and explosives.
        <br/>
        <br/> Open time: Except Friday, this place is open others day from 10.00 am to 6.00 pm

        Liberation war museum is situated in 5 Segun Bagicha Rd, Dhaka and it takes only around 40 minutes to reach there.
        <br/>
        <br/> Liberation war museum (LWM) was established in 1996, to Honor the Bangladeshi people’s heroic struggle for democracy
        and national rights through the armed resistance against the Pakistan Army; after it had unleashed one of the worst
        genocides in history upon the people of then East Pakistan in the middle of night, 25 March 1971. The nine months
        long war led to the emergence of independent Bangladesh as a secular democratic state in December 1971. The museum
        brings to view the untold stories of courage and determination, victory and defiance, heroics and heartbreaks. It
        is run by a Board of Trustees with overwhelming support of all sections of people and is the outcome of citizen’s
        effort at all levels. It is now recognized-nationally and internationally, as a reliable and credible institution
        protecting the history of the emergence of Bangladesh.
        <br/>
        <br/> Currently the Museum’s collection boasts about 14000 objects that include rare photograph, documents, media coverage
        and materials used by freedom fighters and martyrs of the Liberation War. In 1999, the museum, with the assistance
        of Bangladesh Army, excavated two killing fields in Dhaka suburb and these human remains of 1971 genocide added a
        more real dimension to the displays in the museum. Due to space constraints in the rented premises, the museum can
        exhibit about 1300 objects. A plan to build to proper museum on its own land is on the cards and the museum should
        be housed in its own premises by 2014.
        <br/>
        <br/> Visitors of the museum realize how through popular struggle and human sacrifices fundamental principles of democracy,
        secularism and nationalism of Bangladesh constitution (1972) evolved. Attempts have been taken through displays and
        regular programs to create a living museum where visitor/participants can draw contemporary relevance for building
        national unity and a tolerant society against human rights abuses.
        <br/>
        <br/> Open day: Except Sunday, it remains open all others day from 10am to 6pm.

        <br/>
        <br/> Northbrooke Hall, an elegant building popularly known as ‘Lalkuthi’ for its deep red colour, is situated at Farashganj,
        Dhaka on the north bank of the Buriganga River. It was originally built in late 19th century as a Town Hall and named
        after Lord Northbrooke, Viceroy of India (1872-1876). His administration was marked by agrarian unrest in Bengal.
        <br/>
        <br/> Northbrooke Hall combines elements of Mughal architecture blended with architectural styles of the European Renaissance.
        The building's semi-circular horseshoe arches containing entrances on the north, the four octagonal minars with pinnacles
        and the ornamental parapet demonstrate the Muslim features. The deep red color of the grand monument with its graded
        roofs, pinnacles and parapets presents a magnificent view from the riverfront.
        <br/>
        <br/> The town hall was later converted into a public library, to which a clubhouse was added and called Johnson Hall.
        The building, however, has lost its attraction now because of the new structures, such as assembly halls and community
        centres that have been built on the same premises and surround it from all sides. The premises of the hall now offer
        facilities for social and cultural gatherings. The library on the premises is a major reading centre for the people
        of old Dhaka.

        <br/> To see the waves of the Padma River and boat trip, you can go to Moinot Ghat located in Dohar upazila of Nawabgonj.
        The beautiful high waves will enchant your mind. Walking on the bank of the beautiful river, and seeing the boats
        swinging sideways by the waves would make you feel that you are on Cox’s Bazar sea beach not in Dohar, Dhaka. For
        this reason, many people call it ‘Mini Cox’s Bazar’.
        <br/>
        <br/> As Moinot Ghat is not yet known, many nature lovers are deprived of enjoying the beauty of this place. If you go
        there early in the morning then you will see the bazaar of various species of fish including Hilsa. If you want you
        can buy fish at cheat price from here.
        <br/>
        <br/> The best time to enjoy the beauty of Moinot Ghat is rainy reason. It is amazing to see the sunset sitting on the
        bank of the Padma River. Here visitors can see plenty of sailboats of various colours. Local people living in the
        surrounding areas roam into the river with speed boat or trawler during holidays. Tourists start coming from far
        away. It is not like that you will go back just seeing the beach. Besides, you can visit Judge Bari (house), Ukil

        17 minutes to reach Charbhadrasan from quay. If there is strong wave in the Padma River then it will take 20 minutes.

        then you will have to pay Tk 2000 and Tk 1000 for 10 minutes. It is better if some of you can share the rent together.

        about the boat rent. Moreover, if you want to roam onto the river by small engine run boat then you have to pay 300-600

        <br/>
        <br/> where to eat?
        <br/> It will not happen that you will go there but will not eat Hilsa fish. Most of the people have the desire to eat
        Hilsa fish caught from the river sitting on the bank of the Padma River. There are only two hotels in Moinot Ghat
        that sale rice. One is Atahar Chowdhury’s hotel and another one is owned by Julhash Bhuiyan. There is a fast food
        shop named Shikdar Fast Food in Kartikpur. Along with Dhaka hotel, there are some more hotels that also sale rice.
        You should not miss the opportunity to taste the traditional sweets found in Kartikpur. Many people send Kartikpur’s
        traditional sweets abroad. Ranjit and Niranjan mishtannovandar (sweet shops) of Kartikpur bazar have reputation.
        <br/>
        <br/> Additional caution:
        <br/> If you do not know how to swim, it is better not to go very deep into the river while bathing. Do not litter cigarette
        or food packets, water bottle or any kind of dirt here and there. It is your responsibility to protect the nature.
        So, refrain yourself from hunting any kind of birds. At the time of rainsy reason, wave becomes stronger. Do not
        go deep into the river by a very small boat. Do not go to a boat trip withou life jacket if you do not know how to
        swim. Do not travel by a speed boat without wearing life jacket. When going for boat trip, try to enjoy the nature
        instead of creating chaos.
        <br/>

        It is not sure but people believed that they have started their Jomidary(জমিদারী) somewhere around 1890. First Jomidar(জমিদার)
        was Kalichoron Shaha(কালিচরণ সাহা). Beside their Land Lordship, they have conducted trading related to Jute and Salt.
        They were the owner of huge land properties from different part of Bangladesh. During country division and war, most
        of them moved into India. Only very few are living at Tangail(টাঙ্গাইল). Their attractive edifices are now become
        a tourist spot. Since they were rich, people.Says they have built those building before establishing their Zomidari(জমিদারী).
        <br/>
        <br/> Mohera Jomidar Bari(মহেরা জমিদার বাড়ী) has several main buildings. Each of those are presented below with short
        description.
        <br/> -Chowdhury Lodge(চৌধুরী লজ)
        <br/> -Ananda Lodge(আনন্দ লজ)
        <br/> -Kalichoron Lodge(কালিচরণ লজ)
        <br/> -Moharaj Lodge(মহারাজ লজ)
        <br/> -Other Edifices(অন্যান্য ভবন)
        <br/>
        <br/> Where to stay:
        <br/> It is possible to go there and come back with in the same day. So you don't need to stay there during night. Still,
        if you want to stay, that case Jamuna Resort(যমুনা রিসোর্ট), Elenga resort(এলেঙ্গা রিসোর্ট) are the best facilities
        from the district. Also you can check few other hotels from the main town. I didn't stay there ever at night.
        <br/>
        <br/> What to eat:
        <br/> There is a canteen available at Mohera Police Training Center. So you shouldn't be worried about the lunch there.
        <br/>
        <br/> This Jomidar palace is currently undertaken by the Police and they have established a training center there. But
        they allow visitors to visit the Palace for a 20 Taka ticket per person.
        <br/>
        <br/> People can arrange picnic there too. They use to rent the spot for a large group. So if you can take your school
        or college students for a study tour. They will know about our history from close interaction.

        Nuhash Polli was founded in 1987. Initially it covered 22 bigha of land. Now it covers around 40 bigha. Actor Dr. Ejaz helped
        procure the land. The heavenly ‘village’ was named after Nuhash, Humayun Ahmed and Gultekin Khan’s (his first wife)
        son. Ahmed was very fond of music. He loved to live amidst nature and relished the date plantation, which he had
        set up inside Nuhash Polli.
        <br/>
        <br/> Most paths in Pirozali (পিরুজালী) village, under Mirzapur union of Gazipur Sadar Upazila, are lined with thick Shal
        (শাল) forest. One path with its beautiful play of light and shadow, welcomes passers-by, leading them towards Nuhash
        Polli, 25 km from Gazipur Sadar. This was the heaven of Humayun Ahmed, a magician of words, who spent most of his
        time there after he started directing TV plays and films. Nuhash Polli was open to the public and visitors would
        traverse great distances to get a view of the picturesque estate.

        Plans for the monument were initiated in 1976. Following the site selection, road and land development, a nationwide design
        competition was held in June,1978. Following evaluation of the 57 submissions, Syed Mainul Hossain's design was chosen.
        The main structure and the artificial lake and other facilities were completed in 1982. It was Inaugurated at 16
        December 1982.
        <br/>
        <br/> The architecture is composed of seven pairs of triangular-shaped walls or prisms; the outermost pair being the shortest
        in height but widest in span, the inner pairs gradually change their aspect ratio and the innermost pair thus forms
        the peak point of the architecture. Each of these seven pairs of walls represents a significant chapter in the history
        of Bangladesh, namely the Language Movement in 1952, the Election of United Front in 1954, the Constitution Movement
        in 1956, the Education Movement in 1962, 6-point Movement in 1966, the Mass Uprising in 1969, and finally the climatic
        event of Liberation War in 1971, through which Bangladesh was liberated.

        Panam City is situated at Sonargaon, Narayanganj in Bangladesh. It is an ancient historical city in Bangladesh. Among the
        three cities such as boro nogor (Big City), khas Nogor, Panam City, it was most attractive city.[1] There are many
        historical buildings which were built hundreds year ago and those are related with the history of Baro-Bhuyan. It
        covered 20 km area of Sonargaon.
        <br/>
        <br/> As the capital of the fifteenth-century Bengal ruler Isa Khan, and once an important trading and political center,
        Sonargaon boasts architecture of the Sultanate, Mughal, and colonial periods. The Sonargaon historic city, located
        near the present-day capital of Dhaka, includes several Mughal monuments—among them the Sonakanda River Fort, the
        Panch Pir Mazar Shrine, and Ibrahim's and Abdul Hamid's Mosque. British colonial architecture preserved in Sonargaon
        includes the Ananda Mohan Piddar House, and other street-front houses. For travelers making their way along the 2,500-kilometer
        Grand Trunk Road from Peshawar in the Hindu Kush, Sonargaon marked the end of the line. Threats to the site include
        flooding, vandalism, unauthorized occupation, illegal development, poor maintenance, and earthquakes. The low-lying
        terrain of Bangladesh is especially vulnerable to the impacts of global climate change, particularly flooding and
        rising sea levels. Currently, most of Sonargaon's masonry buildings suffer from rising damp and biological and insect
        damage to architectural woodwork. Structural failure is evident in some buildings. At several significant monuments,
        restoration works have been undertaken in an ad hoc fashion by the nation's Department of Archaeology; however that
        institution lacks sufficient funding to carry out the considerable conservation work needed at the site, and requires
        additional support to develop plans for the city's future.
        <br/>
        <br/> Address: Sonargaon Rd, Sonargaon, Bangladesh

        The University of Dhaka is the oldest university in modern Bangladesh. Established in 1921 during the British Raj, it has

        times at different periods of our national history and played vital, at times pioneering, roles in all critical junctures
        in the making of this great nation. The university was set up in a picturesque part of the city on 600 acres of land.
        At present the University consists of 13 Faculties, 77 Departments, 11 Institutes, 20 residential halls, 3 hostels
        and more than 51 Research Centers Though being an educational institute, it has a great value as a tourism destination

        Aparajeyo Bangla is one of the most well-known sculptures dedicated to the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The sculpture
        work was started at the end of 1973 based on sculptor Syed Abdullah Khalid’s design and superintendence of the DUCSU
        Authority. After the war, the DUCSU committee proposed the sculpture to commemorate the glory of liberation. It is
        a sculpture of the three figures, the central character, a village youth stands in the middle clutching the strap
        of a rifle in his hand and a grenade in the left. To the left of him is an urban youth with a rifle. At the right
        is a young lady devoted to nursing with a first aid box at her shoulder. These three represent the concerted strength
        of the whole Bengali nation. Hasina Ahmed, Syed Hamid Maksood and Badrul Alam Benu was modelled for 'Aparajeyo Bangla'.
        The artist closely observed the models' personalities and his close association with them enabled him to do justice
        with his portrayal.
