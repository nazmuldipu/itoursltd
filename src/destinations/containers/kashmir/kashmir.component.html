        of the Aru and Sheshnag Rivers and surrounded by soaring, fir-covered mountains with bare, snow-capped peaks rising
        behind them. At the confluence of the streams flowing from the river Lidder and Sheshnag Lake, Pahalgam was once
        a humble shepherd's village with breathtaking views. A number of hotels and lodges cater to all preferences and budgets,
        from luxurious to unpretentious trekkers' lodges, including JKTDC's delightfully romantic, fully furnished huts,
        partially concealed by giant pine trees.

        PAHALGAM - The Valley of Shepherds. Situated at the confluence of the streams flowing from Sheshnag Lake and the Lidderriver,
        Pahalgam (2,130 m) was once a humble shepherd's village with breathtaking views. Now it is Kashmir's premier resort,
        cool even during the height of summer when the maximum temperature does not exceed 25 deg C.
        <br/>
        <br/> At an altitude of 2,130m and about 95-km from Srinagar, Pahalgam is probably the most popular hill resort in the
        Kashmir valley. Since it is rather lower than Gulmarg the nighttime temperatures do not drop so low and it has the
        further advantage of the beautiful Lidder River running right through the town. Pahalgam is situated at the junction
        of the Aru and Sheshnag Rivers and surrounded by soaring, fir-covered mountains with bare, snow-capped peaks rising
        behind them. At the confluence of the streams flowing from the river Lidder and Sheshnag Lake, Pahalgam was once
        a humble shepherd's village with breathtaking views. A number of hotels and lodges cater to all preferences and budgets,
        from luxurious to unpretentious trekkers' lodges, including JKTDC's delightfully romantic, fully furnished huts,
        partially concealed by giant pine trees.
        <br/>
        <br/> The origin of Pahalgam is obscure. Mughal rulers ruled this region in the medieval period. It was later a part of
        the Kingdom of Kashmir, which was ruled by local Hindu rulers. This princely state remained independent even during
        the British period and later on merged into independent India.
        <br/>
        <br/> Pahalgam is the starting point of the annual Amarnathyatra (holy journey) to the holy cave shrine of Amarnath, which
        is said to be the abode of Lord Shiva. Every year in the month of July/August, thousands of pilgrims descend on Pahalgam
        on their way to the holy cave.
        <br/>
        <br/> Most of the hotels in Pahalgam have their inhouse restaurants where one can order for all types of continental and
        Indian food.There are good number of restaurant in the main market where the tourist can get the fast food as well
        as the mughlaidelicacies.From early morning to late night dinners can be relished at these food joints. During Amarnathyatra
        pure vegetarian food is provided at most of the restaurants and hotel.Thebhojnalyas in the main market also provide
        the Indian food.

        <br/> Kalhana, the author of 'Rajtarangini', states that Srinagri was founded by Emperor Ashoka (3rd Century BC). The
        present city of Srinagar was founded by Pravarasena-II, and Hiuen Tsang, who visited Kashmir in 631 AD, found it
        at the same site as it is today. LaltadityaMuktapida was the most illustrious ruler of Kashmir in the Hindu period,
        which ended in 1339 AD. King Zain-ul-Abidin (1420-70 AD), popularly known as ‘Budshah’, was a great patron of Sanskrit.
        Akbar captured Kashmir valley for the Mughals, who endowed Srinagar with beautiful mosques and gardens. The Sikhs
        overthrew the last Muslim ruler in the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1819. In 1846 the Dogras secured the sovereignty
        of Kashmir from the British under the Treaty of Amrjtsar, and in 1947 the state of Jammu and Kashmir with Srinagar
        as its capital, became part of the Indian Union.
        <br/>
        <br/> Today Srinagar is a resort for the tourist who can experience, at first hand, the peculiar beauty of the valley
        that has attracted the Chinese, the Mughals and the British to it. Its waterways with their own quaint lifestyle,
        the unique Houseboat, the blossoming gardens, water sports activities, shopping for lovingly hand-crafted souvenirs

        was added to it later during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (1628-1658). Covering an area of approximately
        539 m by 182 m, the Shalimar garden offers an amazing view over the other gardens, lakes and shallow terraces. Also
        known as the "garden of love", the Shalimar Mughal Gardens has four terraces, rising one above the other.
        <br/>
        <br/> Shalimar Garden or Shalimar Bagh in Srinagar is the largest Mughal garden in Kashmir valley built by Mughal Emperor
        Jahangir in the year 1619 AD for his wife Empress NurJahan. The term Shalimar comes from Sanskrit language which
        means “Adobe of Love”. This famous garden in sited on the right banks of Dal Lake and the garden is also popularly
        called as Shalamar garden or Bagh, FaizBaksh and Farah Baksh. This garden is the outstanding example of Mughals in
        the field of horticultural. The garden is currently owned and managed by Jammu and Kashmir tourism department.
        <br/>
        <br/> The history of Shalimar Garden can be traced back to second century. It is during that time period King Pravarsena
        II form Vakataka dynasty who ruled Kashmir from 79 AD till 139 AD. King Pravarsena II was the founder of Srinagar
        city who build a cottage surrounded by a park close to Dal Lak and named it Shalimar. The King often visits Saint
        Sukarma Swami at Harwan and after his visit the King stays in Shalimar cottage till then the cottage was well maintained.
        After that the cottage without proper maintenance was ruined and totally was destroyed but the name Shalimar got
        stick to the village and the village was called Shalimar itself.
        <br/>
        <br/> Mughal Emperor Jahangir to please his loving wife NurJahan decided to build a garden which was his dream project
        and he chose Shalimar as the garden location. He renovated the old garden built by King Pravarsena II into a royal
        Mughal garden in 1619 and named it “Farah Baksh” which means “The delightful”. King Jahangir and his wife NurJahan
        along with the entire Jahangir’s court used to spend the summers in Shalimar garden which was their royal summer
        residence. To visit Shalimar they cross snow topped PirPanjal mountain range near Shalimar using elephants.
        <br/>
        <br/> Later in 1630 Kashmir Governor Zafar Khan as per Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan’s order extended the garden and named
        it “FaizBaksh” which means “The Bountiful”. The park during Zafar Khan Administration was also used as an entertaining
        hub for Pathans and Sikh Governors who were friends with Zafar Khan.
        <br/>
        <br/> Apart from Mughals many other rulers also altered Shalimar at various time intervals. Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Sikh
        Empire built a marble guest house in Shalimar for his European guests. Maharaja Hari Singh the last ruling King of
        Jammu and Kashmir from Rajput clans electrified Shalimar. All the rulers gave Shalimar many different names but the
        name Shalimar was mush popular amongst all which stays even today.

        Kashmir is truly described as the paradise on earth and the makers of this paradise on earth were none other than the Mughals.
        The exquisite creation of the Mughals is remarkably reflected in the parks and gardens of Srinagar. Of the beautiful
        parks and gardens of Kashmir, the most significant ones are ChashmaShahi.
        <br/>
        <br/> Terraced lawns, fascinating fountains and floral beds on the banks of Dal Lake constitute the Mughal Gardens one
        of which is the ChashmaShahi. Beautifully terraced garden and a colorful flowers make ChashmaShahi beautiful than
        any other parks and gardens of Kashmir. Originally Shah Jahan's creation in the year 1632 it has undergone a number
        of renovations to retain its remarkable beauty. Shah Jahan named the garden after a mountain spring that waters it
        and so it has the name ChashmaShahi. Get your permits from the information counter to visit this garden in Srinagar.
        The garden was constructed around the spring by the Mughal Governor Ali Mardan Khan in 1632. It was commissioned
        by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his eldest son, DaraSikoh. In the east of ChashmaShahi the PariMahal (Fairy
        Palace) lies where DaraSikoh used to learn astrology and where he was later killed by his brother Aurengzeb. The
        garden is 108 m long and 38 m wide and is spread over one acre of land. It is the smallest garden among the three
        Mughal gardens of Srinagar; the Shalimar garden is the largest and the Nishat garden is the second largest.
        <br/>
        <br/> ChashmaShahi has tastefully laid garden in terraces, which commands a magnificent view of the Dal Lake below and
        surrounding mountain ranges. The cool water of the spring is highly refreshing and digestive. By the side of ChashmaShahi

        Tulip Garden in Kashmir is Asia's largest tulips garden and there is a likely hood that it can become the world’s second
        largest too. The tulip garden which is in Srinagar is commonly known as SirajBagh and is located on the banks of
        the famous Dal Lake. When viewing the garden you are able to see the large variety of colors of the flowers, and
        there are over 60 varieties of early, mid and late blooming tulips.
        <br/>
        <br/> The tourism authorities in the state said they are using the festival to promote the state as a preferred destination.
        "ot of Indians go to Holland just to see tulips, but now this place is near and more affordable for the domestic
        tourists. We feel we will get more tourists. We have come to know that about 12, 00 tourists and mostly outsiders
        have come here," said TanveerJahan, a secretary of tourism department. The garden at the foothills of Zabarwan overlooking
        the famed Dal Lake has about 60 varieties of multi-colored tulips. The festival that also showcased, the state's
        traditional art and culture, was an instant hit with the foreigners. "You cannot find any of these products in other
        parts of India. I have not seen something like this," said Peter Mathew, a tourist from Chile. Lot of domestic tourists
        also visited the festival.
        <br/>
        <br/> "The variety and the colour are very good. The art collection, the shawls and also the climate is very good," said
        Minakshi, an Indian tourist. 'SirajBagh', which has become home to tulips in Kashmir, has a unique and feasible topography
        that suits different varieties of flowers. It has slopes suited for different varieties of fruit plants and wilderness
        suitable for wild flora and bushes.
        <br/>
        <br/> Tulip, which has its origin in Persia (Iran), was introduced in Europe in 17th century, where it had been developed
        in different varieties. Holland is the largest producer of tulips, which inhabits the mountain areas extending from
        Europe to Central Asia. The plantation of tulips begins from September, before the start of winter season.
        <br/>
        <br/> Indira Gandhi Tulip Garden is located at the foothills of the Zabarwan Mountains which are present on the banks
        of the Dal Lake, Srinagar. This garden is the most spacious one in Srinagar as compared to the other Mughal Gardens
        which I saw earlier. The major attraction here is the large variety of Tulips found in thousands of numbers. The
        sight is heavenly during the full bloom season with all shades of the rainbow scattered on the fields of this garden.

        Dal Lake has rightfully become an icon of the Kashmir tourism industry. A Himalayan urban lake, it has five basins and a
        number of channels that are well linked with each other. There are plenty of fishes in Dal Lake and fishery is the
        second largest industry of the region centered on the lake. The sparkling quiet waters of Dal surrounded by snow-capped
        mountains on its three sides, undoubtedly mark it as one of the most beautiful lakes of India. It is also the second
        largest lake in the State of Jammu and Kashmir with numerous gardens and orchards all along its shores. Houseboats
        form an indelible part of the scenery of the Dal Lake that are always ready to take tourists to a romantic and peaceful
        ride of the lake and soothe their nerves as the houseboat floats over the slightly rippling waters. They also offer
        some of the most exotic views of the splendid scenery of the Dal Lake.
        <br/>
        <br/> There are Shikaras that look like small ornate versions of the gondolas of Venice that offers ferry rides to and
        from the banks of the lake to the houseboats. The shores of the Lake houses the distinct Moghul monuments and the
        campus of the Kashmir University while the two hillocks overlooking the lake house Shankar Acharya and Hari Parbat
        temples. The glorious Mughal gardens on its shores contribute to the beauty of the Dal Lake. Out of about five hundred
        gardens laid down in 16th to 17th century, only a few still survive. There have been controversies about the origin
        of the Dal Lake. While some geologists believe that the origins of Dal Lake lie in the Pleistocene Oligotrophic Lake
        that once covered the entire valley of Kashmir, others just believe it to be a flood plain lake. The floating gardens
        of Dal Lake are considered a beauty in themselves. One can find a number of restaurants and hotels at the lakefront
        that have sprung up, encouraged by the large influx of tourists here.
        <br/>
        <br/> The shore line of the lake, is about 15.5 kilometers (9.6 mi), is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era
        gardens, parks, houseboats and hotels. Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens,
        such as Shalimar BaghandNishatBagh built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir and from houseboats cruising
        along the lake in the colorful shikaras. During the winter season, the temperature sometimes reaches −11 °C (12 °F),
        freezing the lake. The lake covers an area of 18 square kilometers (6.9 sq. mi) and is part of a natural wetland
        which covers 21.1 square kilometers (8.1 sq. mi), including its floating gardens. The floating gardens, known as
        "Rad" in Kashmiri, blossom with lotus flowers during July and August. The wetland is divided by causeways into four
        basins; Gagribal, Lokut Dal, Bod Dal and Nagin (although Nagin is also considered as an independent lake). Lokut-dal
        and Bod-dal each have an island in the centre, known as Rup Lank (or Char Chinari) and Sona Lank respectively. At
        present, the Dal Lake and its Mughal gardens, Shalimar Bagh and the NishatBagh on its periphery are undergoing intensive
        restoration measures to fully address the serious eutrophication problems experienced by the lake. Massive investments
        of approximately US$275 million (₹ 11 billion) are being made by the Government of India to restore the lake to its
        original splendor.

        <br/> The mosque has a deep-rooted history that dates back to the 17th century. The place where the mosque stands today
        was originally the site of IshratMahal and a garden, which were built in 1623 by Shah Jahan'ssubedarSadiq Khan. Upon
        his arrival in 1634, Shah Jahan ordered to convert the palace into a place for offering prayers. When Moi-e-Muqqadas
        arrived in Kashmir in 1699, it was kept in the Naqashbad Sahib for some time, before becoming a part of the Hazratbal.
        Although this shrine is frequented by locals on Fridays for mass prayers, it experiences an influx of visitors on

        Nagin Lake in Srinagar is a deep blue water offshoot lake of Dal Lake that is interconnected by a thin causeway. The lake
        is located to the east of the city of Srinagar, at the foothill of the Zabarwan Mountain. The Shankaracharya Hill
        on the south and Hari Parbat on the west enclose the Nagin Lake offers breathtaking views to the visitors. It is
        flanked by beautiful willow and poplar trees. Good numbers of houseboats and shikaras can be seen in Nagin Lake where
        tourists enjoy their peaceful vacations in Srinagar. Unlike Dal Lake, Nagin Lake is a calm, serene and peaceful getaway
        for those who want to spend holiday in sheer nature. Apart from houseboat staying and shikara ride, tourists can
        also enjoy water skiing, motor rides and sailing over there.
        <br/>
        <br/> The Nigeen Lake is surrounded by a large number of willow and poplar trees. Hence, it has come to be referred as
        a "nageena", which means "the jewel in the ring". The word "nigeen" is a local variant of the same word.
        <br/>
        <br/> The lake is located adjacent to the Hari Parbat hillock, to the west of the Dal Lake. To its north and west, lie
        the localities of Baghwanpora and Lal Bazar while to its north east lies the locality of Hazratbal, which is known
        for the famous shrine.
        <br/>
        <br/> The lake is a major tourist attraction in Srinagar, known for its relatively pristine waters as compared to the
        Dal Lake. Houseboats and shikaras are a usual sight. It’s also ideal for swimming, being deeper and less crowded
        than the Dal Lake.
        <br/>
        <br/> However, as is the problem with other water bodies in the Kashmir Valley, the lake also suffers from encroachments
        which are deteriorating its water quality and also increasing the risk of floods. As such, the government of Jammu
        and Kashmir is engaged in taking steps to help improve the condition of the lake and restore it to its original glory.

        Charar-e-Sharief is located on the way to Yusmarg, 40 kilometers from Srinagar. Charar-i-sharief is probably one of the most
        ancient of shrines which stands tall in the valley of Jammu & Kashmir. Inheriting a heritage of about 600 years old,
        Charar-i-sharief was built to pay homage to one of the holy saints of Sufism - Sheikh Noor-ud-Din Noorani. Also referred
        as Hazrat Sheikh Noor-ud-Din Wali, Charar-i-sharief has went through many a tumultuous times. During the war of Indian
        and Pakistani Army, the shrine was badly devastated. However, through the diligent efforts of the local governing
        authorities Charar-i-sharief was again reconstructed. Then there was a militant attack on the shrine in the year
        1995 due to which a major portion of Charar-i-sharief was broken. This was also repaired in due time. The historic
        tales behind Charar-i-sharief narrates an array of interesting anecdotes. The mention of Sheikh Noor-ud-Din Noorani
        who took birth in 1377 is all-pervasive in the saga of the origin of Charar-i-sharief. Called by the name of Sahazanand
        or NundReshi, Noor-ud-Din Noorani propounded the significance of Rishism in the valley of Jammu & Kashmir centuries
        ago. During his entire life, Noor-ud-Din Noorani spread the message of tolerance, vegetarianism and communal peace
        among the local people of the valley.
        <br/>
        <br/> On the occasion of his death in 1438, it is believed that as much as nine lakh followers came to Charar-i-sharief
        to pay their homage to Noor-ud-Din Noorani. Preserving the remains of Noor-ud-Din Noorani, Charar-i-sharief today
        is regarded as one of the holiest of places of Muslim sect. A great philosopher who had a mastery over poetry and
        verses, Noor-ud-Din Noorani was also known by several names such as Alamdar-e-Kashmir, Sheikh-ul-Alam and Sarkhel-e-Rishiya,
        among others.

        Aharbal is a hill station in the south-western part of Kashmir Valley in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, 75 km south
        of the state capital Srinagar.
        <br/>
        <br/> Aharballies in the Kulgam district of Jammu and Kashmir. It is located on the Veshu River, a tributary of the Jehlum
        River, in analpine valley covered in pine and fir trees within the PirPanjal Mountains, 18 km south of the town of
        Shopian and 28 km west ofKulgam. It lies at an altitude of 2266 metres above sea level.
        <br/>
        <br/> Aharbal is known for its waterfall, Aharbal Falls, where the Veshu falls noisily 25 metres and 7 metres through
        a narrow gorge of granite boulders. Aharbal Falls are also referred to as the Niagara Falls of Kashmir, owing to
        the volume of the water that falls. According to a report,[specify] the water volume would be sufficient to generate
        100 MW of hydroelectricity. The terraces leading to the falls are fenced, but care must be taken to avoid slipping.
        <br/>
        <br/> Aharbal is a base for adventure tourism. The Veshu River is stocked with trout. The fishing permit can be obtained
        from the Fisheries department stationed at Aharbal. The alpine meadow of Kungwatan lies at the halfway point of the
        two-day trek to the high-altitude Konsernag Lake, which is the source of the Veshu. Other activities include horse
        riding, photography, and skiing during winter. The Aharbal Development Authority, a government agency responsible
        for development in Aharbal, has built tourist infrastructure including huts and a cafeteria, and other lodging and
        boarding facilities have also been made available.

        Doodhpathri is a beautiful meadow with emerald grass that looks like a green carpet. A beautiful river dancing and reverberating
        with the wind flows in the middle of the meadow, lending it a splendid charm and vibrancy. The place looks very beautiful
        and pleasant. The green grass under the feet is really wonderful.
        <br/>
        <br/> Doodhpathri however is a recent inclusion in the Jammu Kashmir tourist map. This is the reason that the place is
        not overcrowded and not many tourists visit here. However, it has become a real hit among the local population, who
        find it a welcome step. The road from Khansahib area in Badgam to the Doodhpathri is not in a good condition. There
        is not a full-fledged market or any hotel in the area, so the trip is always going to last for a day only and you
        need to pack your lunch. Tea and snacks are available in the shops run by local people.
        <br/>
        <br/> Travelling to the area can be hectic, but the place is worth the trouble. The local government is taking steps on
        fast track basis to make the access easier and comfortable. Work is going on to connect Doodhpathri with all the
        concrete roads. Once completed, it is believed that the place will be at no. 3 of the most preferred tourist destinations
        of the valley.
        <br/>
        <br/> As already mentioned, travelling can be hectic. You need to take a bus to Budgam from Lalchowk Srinagar, from where
        you can catch a vehicle to Khansahib. From Khansahib stand you can get a cab for Doodhpathri. Alternatively if you
        come to Kashmir by Air, you can take the bus to Budgam from Humhama area, just two kilometers from the Airport.
        <br/>
        <br/> Weather of the place remains moderate. The best time to visit is during the spring and summer months from May to
        September. The place is primarily for sightseeing as it has not been developed completely as yet.
