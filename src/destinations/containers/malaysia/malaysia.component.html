    Malaysia is a Southeast Asian country occupying parts of the Malay Peninsula and the island of Borneo. It's known for its
    beaches, rainforests and mix of Malay, Chinese, Indian and European cultural influences. The capital, Kuala Lumpur, is
    home to colonial buildings, busy shopping districts such as Bukit Bintang and skyscrapers such as the iconic, 451m-tall
    Petronas Twin Towers.

        This is a must see if you're into marvels of engineering or just an awesome view of KL. The tour involves a stop in the sky
        bridge that connects both towers , and then a trip to the observation deck, when you get to spend a reasonable amount
        of time sightseeing the KL skyline. There's also a massive shopping center on the main level and great places to
        eat or just drop by for a latte.

        Taman Negara was established at the Titiwangsa Mountains, Malaysia, in 1938/1939 as the King George V National Park. It was
        renamed to Taman Negara after independence, which means "national park" in Malay. Taman Negara has a total area of
        4,343 km2 and has a reputation as the world's oldest deciduous rainforest, estimated to be more than 130 million
        years old. Despite the reputation, the title of "oldest tropical rainforest" more accurately belongs to the Daintree
        Rainforest in Queensland, Australia, estimated to be between 135 million years old and 180 million years old.
